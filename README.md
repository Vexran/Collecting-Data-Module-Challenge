# Collecting-Data-Module-Challenge

### Analysis

Through this challenge, I organized and evaluated the data through a bunch of high schools using tools such as pandas and python.  I could find the average budget for each school and the total number of students through each school.  I made a data frame with the information provided to find the mean and minimum of all students that did well.  So far, the challenges I faced were trying to make sure everything I placed was correct or looking into different syntaxes to ensure the answer was correct.
